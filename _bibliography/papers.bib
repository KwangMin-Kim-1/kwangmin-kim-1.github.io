  title={Modeling and velocity-field control of autonomous excavator with main control valve},
  abstract={We propose a novel modeling and control framework for the autonomous excavator with main control valve (MCV), which distributes fluid from pumps to hydraulic actuators with the number of the pumps less than that of the actuators and whose internal hydraulic circuitry switches depending on operating conditions and internal pressures. We first derive the mathematical model of the MCV, including the switching components and supply pump flow constraint. We then design a novel velocity-field control for the bucket position/orientation, which, by relying on a constrained-optimization formulation, can adjust the velocity-field following speed reflecting the physical constraints imposed by the MCV in such a way that the bucket fully follows the desired velocity-field when the constraints are inactive or still preserves the desired direction (or automatic stopping) while slowing down when the constraints become active (e.g. flow saturation). We further show that this optimization can be reduced to simple real-time solvable formulation with its solution existence/optimality (or suboptimality) guaranteed. Simulation is also performed to verify the theory by using a detailed Simulink/Sim-Hydraulics model.},

  title={Optimal Estimation of Gasoline LP-EGR via Unscented Kalman Filtering with Mixed Physics-based/Data-driven Components Modeling},
  abstract={We propose a novel optimal estimation methodology for gasoline engine LP (low-pressure) EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) air-path system, which allows us to implement virtual sensors for oxygen mass fraction at the intake manifold and EGR mass flow rate at the LP-EGR valve, real sensors for them too expensive to deploy in production cars. We first decompose the LP-EGR air-path system into several sub-components; and opportunistically utilize physics-based modeling or data-driven modeling for each component depending on their model complexity. In particular, we apply the technique of MLP (multi-layer perceptron) as a means for data-driven modeling of LP-EGR/throttle valves and engine cylinder valve aspiration dynamics, all of which defy accurate physics-based modeling, that is also simple enough for real-time running. We further optimally combine these physics-based and data-driven modelings in the framework of UKF (unscented Kalman filtering), and also manifest via formal analysis that this mixed physics-based/data-driven modeling renders our estimator much faster to run as compared to the case of full data-driven MLP modeling. In doing so, we also extend the standard UKF theory to the more general case, where the system contains non-additive uncertainties both in the measurement and process models with cross-correlations and state-dependent variances, which stems from the inherent peculiar structure of our mixed physics-based/data-driven modeling approach, for the UKF formulation. Experiments are also performed to show the theory.},

  title={Preliminary result on passivity boundary of inertia scaling control for human interactive robot},
  abstract={We present a preliminary result on a minimum inertia scale factor that can be passively implemented into a human-robot interacting system. We model the robot including essential system components (e.g. force sensor dynamics and digital controller), and we analyze the energetics of this model using the frequency property of the human force. The resulting passivity condition is verified by simulations.},

  title={Auto-Stop of Excavator using Passivity-based control of MCV},
  abstract={We propose a passivity-based control framework for the excavator with main control valve (MCV). We first derive mathematical model of a 4-way valve, then develop a passivity-based control rule using spool actuation forces as control inputs. The passivity-based control is done in two steps: 1) MCV passifying control and 2) spool actuation control. First, the flow rate of each valve in MCV is decomposed into active flow source and a passive dissipation, and valve passifying control is presented based on this structure. Second, we present a spool actuation input to control the spool position to the desired value. In addition, we compensate the self-weight in order to make the passivity of the excavator less conservative. Finally, we propose a passivity-based auto-stop function of excavator when it collides with an underground obstacle.},
