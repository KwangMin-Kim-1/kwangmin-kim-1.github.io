Hello! I am currently working as a Senior Robotics Research Engineer at Samsung Electronics. I received my Ph.D. degree from the [Interactive & Networked Robotics Laboratory (INRoL)](https://www.inrol.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University (SNU), where I was advised by Prof. [Dongjun Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qKexATgAAAAJ&hl=en), and I obtained my bachelor's degree from SNU.

My research interests lie across **robotics, control theory, optimization, and robot learning**. Currently, my work at Samsung Electronics is centered on robot learning with a keen interest in robotic manipulation and was centered also on optimization-based robot motion planning and control with keen interests in locomotion and navigation. My work at SNU was centered on optimization-based control and probabilistically optimal nonlinear state estimation of complex mechanical systems.
